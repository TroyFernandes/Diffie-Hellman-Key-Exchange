# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm Implemented in C with OpenSSL

[Diffie Hellman Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) is a method of securely exchanging keys over a public channel and was one of the
first public-key protocols. It allows people with no prior knowledge of each other to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
It should be noted that no one ever uses this algorithm because of how easy it is to brute force with technology today, and with the fact that 
large amounts of data/work has to be done by both parties.
